**COMPREHENSIVE WEB DESIGN ENHANCEMENT PROMPT:**

**Project Context:**
I have an MVP website for "The Unlock" - an AI consulting company. I need you to transform this basic HTML/CSS into a professional, modern website that looks enterprise-ready.

**Current Code:** [Insert our HTML here]

**SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:**

**1. VISUAL DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS:**
- Add professional hero section with background image/gradient
- Implement subtle animations (fade-ins, hover effects, smooth transitions)
- Add depth with strategic shadows and layering
- Create visual hierarchy with improved typography scaling
- Add professional icons for process steps and features

**2. IMAGE INTEGRATION:**
- Hero section: Professional business/tech background image
- Why section: Professional headshot placeholder (300x400px)
- Team section: Professional team member photos (circular, 200x200px)
- Process section: Modern icons or illustrations for each step
- Partnership section: Subtle background pattern or tech imagery

**3. MODERN UI ELEMENTS:**
- Smooth scroll navigation with active states
- Interactive buttons with hover animations
- Cards with subtle hover elevations
- Professional form styling with focus states
- Loading animations and micro-interactions

**4. TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS:**
- Optimize mobile responsiveness (especially partnership grid)
- Add subtle parallax or scroll-triggered animations
- Implement smooth transitions between sections
- Add professional loading states
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus states)

**5. BRAND CONSISTENCY:**
- Use color palette: #00a8b5, #ffffff, #111111, #00d7e8, #007982, #e6e6e6
- Maintain professional B2B aesthetic
- Ensure enterprise-level credibility

**6. PERFORMANCE:**
- Optimize images for web
- Minimize CSS and ensure fast loading
- Use efficient animations (CSS transforms over DOM manipulation)

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Complete working website with all enhancements
- Professional placeholder images that I can replace later
- Modern, enterprise-ready appearance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast loading and smooth interactions

Make this look like a $50,000 enterprise consulting website, not an MVP.
