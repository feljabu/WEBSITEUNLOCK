    challenge: "ELMO's Sales Development Representatives were spending hours manually researching prospects before every callâ€”gathering company intelligence, LinkedIn insights, and market news. This manual process was time-consuming and inconsistent, limiting the team's ability to scale while maintaining the depth of insights needed for effective conversations. The real challenge wasn't just building an AI agent that could automate complex research while maintaining quality and depth. It was creating something the team would actually embrace and use, transforming resistance into adoption while building organisational confidence in AI capabilities.",
    solution: "We developed NALAH, an agentic AI system designed to autonomously research and analyse prospects by gathering intelligence from multiple sources. NALAH integrates with LinkedIn for professional insights, performs comprehensive web research, and leverages Perplexity to analyse current news and market trends. Built using n8n and Claude, this multi-source approach delivers comprehensive prospect intelligence that previously required hours of manual research.",
    implementation: "NALAH was built in 8 weeks from concept to launch. The agent was co-created with the SDR team, who became architects of their own workflow, defining what insights mattered and how they wanted to work. This collaborative approach transformed initial resistance into ownership. NALAH integrates directly into ELMO's existing workflows, operating autonomously and requiring minimal user input while delivering comprehensive research reports. The focus on co-design ensured the system enhanced rather than replaced human expertise.",

      quote: "A massive thank you to Felipe Jara for demonstrating how we should be approaching all future Agentic AI initiatives. Watching this project evolve from concept to these stunning results has been a highlight this quarter. You've perfectly demonstrated a core belief for our organisation: AI that is built WITH the user will always outperform AI that is simply built FOR the user.",
